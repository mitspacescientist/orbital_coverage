Computes optimal number of planes and satellites required for Iridium-like constellations

This tiny program uses publically available physics and mathematics to design an Iridium-like communication satellite constellation for any planetary body. Built-in information allows quick study of Earth, the Moon, and other Solar planetary bodies. If you have the necessary information for some other body (like one of the moons of Saturn, for example), you can see what it would require to make a constellation for that body.

This might seem frivolous at first, but with the advent of small satellites, such a system might be of use around Earth's Moon or, perhaps for a mission or base on Mars. It's ok to dream!
